The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen.
 It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach
 in Bad Cannstatt,Germany, in 1885.[10] This vehicle was unlike either the safety
 bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering
 axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and
 motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two 
 outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle">
A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, cycle, or (if three-wheeled) trike,
 is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies 
 greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, 
 cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding 
 a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining 
 a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
