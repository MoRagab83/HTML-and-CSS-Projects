The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white,
 is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. 
 It is notable for its size, with larger female individuals growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,905–2,268 kg
 (4,200–5,000 lb) in weight at maturity.[3][4][5] However, most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft),
 and females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average.[4][6] According to a 2014 study, the lifespan of great white sharks
 is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates,[7] making it one of the longest lived 
 cartilaginous fishes currently known.[8] According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach 
 sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.[9] Great white sharks can swim at 
 speeds of 25 km/hr (16 mph)[10] for short bursts and to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).

 <h2>hammerhead sharks</h2>
 <p>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks that form the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive
 structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a "hammer" shape called a cephalofoil.
 Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna, while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus,
 Eusphyra. Many different, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, functions have been postulated for the cephalofoil,
 including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. The cephalofoil gives the shark superior binocular
 vision and depth perception.</p>
