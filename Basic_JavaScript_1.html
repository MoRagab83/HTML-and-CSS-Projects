The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen.
 It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach
 in Bad Cannstatt,Germany, in 1885.[10] This vehicle was unlike either the safety
 bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering
 axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and
 motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two 
 outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.

The first-ever Harley Davidson motorcycle only went 40km/h. It had a single-cylinder engine that actually used a tomato can as its carburetor.
The world’s most expensive motorcycle costs $360,000! It's the Feline One, created by Feline Motorcycles. Some of the materials used to create it are titanium, carbon, and aerospace aluminum.
Motorcycles are extremely fuel-efficient.  Although we all know they are more fuel-efficient than cars or trucks, did you know the Verucci Nitro 50 can go 172 km on one gallon of gas?
The use of a helmet was authorized following Colonel T.E. Lawrence’s death. He was killed in a motorcycle accident after he swerved to avoid two young boys riding on their bicycles.
Motorcycles have been around since the 1800s! Edward Butler designed and created the world’s first motorcycle in 1884. It wasn’t nearly as powerful and exciting as motorcycles are today, but it created the industry we are all so invested in now.
The longest distance ever ridden on a motorcycle in 24 hours was 3256.5 km. Matthew McKelvey set this Guinness World Record in 2014 while riding in South Africa.
Horses were used as a method of transportation for messengers during World War 1 but were soon overtaken by the use of motorcycles.</font></i></p>
<p><U><font color="#FFD700">A motorcycle (or motorbike) is a vehicle used to transport people from one place to another. It does not have 4 wheels like a car. It has 2 wheels like a bicycle. But it has a motor like a car. A motorcycle is normally driven by one person. A passenger can also ride on the back of the motorcycle. Some motorcycles have a sidecar that can carry another passenger.

In 1901, the first successful motorcycle was made by "Indian" motorcycles in Springfield, Massachusetts. Since then, many other companies have made them. Major manufacturers include Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha. A well known American manufacturer of motorcycles is Harley-Davidson.

Since motorcycles can be lighter than cars, they can accelerate more quickly. But it also makes them not as safe as cars, because they do not have a protecting chassis around them like cars. Very often motorcycle riders are injured heavily in accidents. A motorcycle rider can wear a helmet and clothing that has armor. This special clothing may reduce the rider's injuries in an accident. Motorcycles also do not protect riders against wind and rain. That makes it difficult to drive in winter or during bad weather.

In poor countries, motorcycles are used by many as a cheap method of transportation. Many people who do not have the money to buy a car can afford a small motorcycle. In rich countries, large powerful motorcycles are used more as a hobby or sport.

On-road bikes (ones that are allowed on public roads) require the rider to have a special type of driver's license to be ridden legally. Off-road bikes are not allowed to be driven on public roads.

Speed and stunts are the main goals for off-road bike sports. Many on-road bikes are much faster than off-road bikes and can be used in sports such as motorbike racing.</font></U></p>
